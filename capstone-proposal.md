### Name of Student: Henry Sullivan

### Name of Project: C# Cellar

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

The purpose of this project is to build an app that allows users to keep track of their wine collection. This includes things like logging the information about the wine, where the user obtained it, and location of the wine in the user's cellar. Upon drinking the wine, the user should be able to add tasting notes and a rating to the wine.
It will also have an education section for teaching users about famous wine regions around the world.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Full CRUD funcionality for wines in the cellar
* Upon drinking, user should be prompted to add tasting notes and rating.
* There should be an API (custom built or sourced) that provides information about various wine regions.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* C#
* ASP.Net Core 6 MVC
* EF Core 6
* mySQL
* Identity
* Linq
* Swagger

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
